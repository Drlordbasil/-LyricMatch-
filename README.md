## Description

The "Lyric Matcher" is a Python-based program that utilizes web scraping and natural language processing techniques to help users find the right song based on a snippet of lyrics or a description of the song. It aims to provide a convenient way for music enthusiasts to discover songs they're looking for, even if they don't have much information about them.

The program will scrape popular lyrics websites such as Genius or AZLyrics to gather a vast collection of song lyrics and metadata. By allowing users to input a snippet of lyrics or describe the song they're looking for, the program will employ NLP algorithms to process the input and match it with relevant songs in the dataset. Through analyzing the lyrics, it will calculate the similarity between the input and the lyrics of various songs, ultimately generating a list of song suggestions ranked by similarity score.

The interactive interface will enable users to input their lyrics or song description and view the matched songs. Additionally, the interface will provide additional information such as song title, artist name, album, and a link to listen to the song on supported platforms like Spotify or YouTube.

## Key Features

1. **Web Scraping**: The program will scrape popular lyrics websites to collect a vast collection of song lyrics and metadata.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Users can input a snippet of lyrics or describe the song they're looking for, and the program will utilize NLP algorithms to process the input and match it with relevant songs in the dataset.

3. **Similarity Matching**: By analyzing the lyrics, the program will calculate the similarity between the input and the lyrics of various songs. It will then generate a list of song suggestions ranked by similarity score.

4. **Interactive Interface**: The program will provide an interactive interface where users can input their lyrics or song description and view the matched songs. The interface will also display additional information such as song title, artist name, album, and a link to listen to the song on supported platforms.

5. **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: The program will dynamically retrieve the necessary data including lyrics and song metadata from the web using tools such as BeautifulSoup or Google Python libraries, ensuring access to the latest and most up-to-date information.

## Potential Extensions

1. **Audio Matching**: Enhance the program to allow users to submit an audio snippet of a song, which will be processed and matched with the audio samples in the dataset to find the corresponding song.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement sentiment analysis on song lyrics to provide users with additional information about the emotional tone of the song.

3. **Recommendation System**: Incorporate a recommendation system that suggests similar songs or artists based on user preferences and previous search history.

4. **Mobile App Integration**: Create a mobile app version of the Lyric Matcher that allows users to conveniently search for songs on their smartphones or tablets.

## Usage

To use the Lyric Matcher, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 difflib
```

2. Import the LyricMatcher class from the provided Python file:
```python
from lyric_matcher import LyricMatcher
```

3. Create an instance of the LyricMatcher class:
```python
matcher = LyricMatcher()
```

4. Input your desired lyrics or song description to search:
```python
input_lyrics = "I want to hold your hand"
```

5. Search for lyrics matching the input:
```python
search_results = matcher.search_lyrics(input_lyrics)
```

6. Display the search results:
```python
if search_results:
    for result in search_results:
        print(f"Title: {result['title']}")
        print(f"Artist: {result['artist']}")
        print(f"Link: {result['link']}")
        print()
    selected_song_link = search_results[0]["link"]
    print("Selected Song Link:", selected_song_link)
else:
    print("No search results found.")
```

7. Find similar songs based on the input lyrics:
```python
matched_songs = matcher.find_song(input_lyrics)
if matched_songs:
    for song in matched_songs:
        print(f"Title: {song['title']}")
        print(f"Artist: {song['artist']}")
        if len(song["lyrics"]) > 200:
            print(f"Lyrics:\n{song['lyrics'][:200]}...")
        else:
            print(f"Lyrics:\n{song['lyrics']}")
        print(f"Similarity: {song['similarity']}")
        print(f"Website: {song['website']}")
        print()
else:
    print("No matched songs found.")
```
